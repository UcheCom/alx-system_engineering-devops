# Postmortem: Web Stack Outage
### Issue Summary:

### Duration:
* Start Time: January 25, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC
* End Time: January 25, 2024, 3:45 PM UTC
### Impact:
* Service: Web application API
* Users Affected: 30% of users experienced intermittent connectivity issues, slow response times, or complete service unavailability.

## Timeline:

### Detection:

* Start Time: January 25, 2024, 10:30 AM UTC
* How: Monitoring alerts indicated a spike in error rates and latency.

### Actions Taken:

* Investigated database servers for performance issues.
* Assumed database overload due to recent feature rollout.
* Checked network configurations and load balancer settings.

### Misleading Paths:

* Initially assumed a DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in traffic.
* Explored potential issues with third-party services.
* Considered recent code deployments as a possible cause.

### Escalation:

* Incident escalated to the DevOps and Database teams after initial investigation.
* Engaged network specialists to examine potential external threats.

### Resolution:

* Identified a database query bottleneck leading to excessive resource consumption.
* Implemented a temporary fix by optimizing the problematic query.
* Stabilized service by redistributing traffic and scaling database resources.

# Root Cause and Resolution:

### Root Cause:

* A poorly optimized database query was causing high CPU and memory usage.
* The recent feature rollout triggered an increase in the frequency of this problematic query.

### Resolution:

* Optimized the database query to reduce resource consumption.
* Deployed the optimized query to the production environment.
* Conducted load testing to ensure the issue was fully resolved.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures:

### Improvements/Fixes:

* Implement comprehensive monitoring for database performance metrics.
* Establish automated alerts for abnormal query behavior.
* Conduct regular performance audits after feature rollouts.

### Tasks:

* Patch and update the database management system to the latest version.
* Conduct a thorough code review to identify and optimize resource-intensive queries.
* Enhance documentation for troubleshooting database-related issues.
* Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for critical database components.
* Schedule regular training sessions for the development team on writing efficient database queries.
